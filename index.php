    <h1>Welcome to NEMAID</h1>
    <p>NEMAID is an identification aid that calculates the similarity between the specimens to be identified and all of the species in a genus. </br>It does not give one answer but a list of species that are most similar to the unknown specimens. </br>It is then up to the user to study the published descriptions of the likely candidates and make the final identification.</p>
    <p>NEMAID was first implemented in 1983 and an improved version was proposed in 1985.</br> Nemaid 3.0 was implemented in 2012 and the current version (3.4) in 2017. The earlier versions were described in the following publications.</p>
